**CIT114 - Notes 09, Cloud Architecture**

*Architecture*

- art and science of designing and building large structures
- cloud architects engage with decision makers to identify business goal and the capabilities that need improvement

*AWS Well-Architected Framework*

- a guide for designing infrastructures

*Operational Excellence Pillar*

- focuses on the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve operations.

*Six design principles for operational excellence in the cloud*

- 1. perform operations as code
  2. annotate documentation
  3. make frequent, small, reversible changes
  4. refine operationbs procedures frequently
  5. anticipate failure
  6. learn from all operational events and failures
 
*Security Pillar*

- focuses on the ability to protect information, systems, and assests while deliversing business value through risk assessment and mitagation strategies.

*Seven Design Principles to Increase Security*

- 1. implement a strong foundation
  2. enable traceability
  3. applysecurity best practices
  4. protect data in transit and at rest
  5. keep people away from data
  6. prepare for security events

*Realiability Pillar*

- focuses on the ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service distruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand and mitigate disruptions.

*Five Design Principles that can increase reliability*

- 1. test recovery procedures
  2. automatically recover from failure
  3. scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
  4. stop guessing capacity
  5. manage change in automation
 
*Performance Efficiency Pillar*

- focuses on the ability to use IT and computing resources effeciently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demands or technologies change.

*Five design principles that can improve perfomance efficiency*

- 1. denocratize advanced technologies
  2. go global in minutes
  3. use serverless architectures
  4. experiment more often
  5. have mechanical sympathy

*Cost Optimization Pillar*

- focuses on the ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point

*Five design principles that can optimize costs*

- 1. adopt a consumption model
  2. measure overall efficiency
  3. stop spending money on data center operations
  4. analyze and attribute expenditure
  5. use managed and application-level services to reduce cost of ownership
 
*Reliability*

- a measure of your system's ability to provide functionality when desired by the user

*Availability*

- the percentage of time that a system is operating normally or correctly performing the operations of it or normal operation time over total time.
- percentage of uptime

*High availability*

- one that can withstand some measures of degradation while still remaining available.

*AWS Trusted Advisor*

- online tool that provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices
- looks at your entire AWS environment and gives you real-time recommendations in five categories

*Five Categories*

- 1. cost optimization
  2. performance
  3. security
  4. fault tolerance
  5. service limits
  
**Question 2**

>Before you architect any system, you must put security practices in place.

- It is very important to implement security if all, for extra protection against hackers. Such as the MGM hack, there should have been extra security implemented.

>Serverless architectures can also lower transactional costs because managed services operate at cloud scale.

- There's so much savings in AWS cloud that a company before couldn't do.

**Question 4**

- With so much security implemented, is there still a possibility of a breach?
